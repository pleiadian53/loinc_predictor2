Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.   This test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano.

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.   This test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano.

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C.",LIVER FIBROSIS PANEL,Protein [Mass/time] in 24 hour Urine,Prot 24h Ur-mRate,Protein,Urine,,MRat

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C. - SteatoTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - NashTest is interpretable for non alcoholic steatosis. - AshTest is interpretable for alcoholic steatosis.",FIBROACT COMPLETE,Hepatitis B virus core IgM Ab [Presence] in Serum or Plasma by Immunoassay,HBV core IgM SerPl Ql IA,Hepatitis B virus core Ab.IgM,Ser/Plas,IA,PrThr

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C.",LIVER FIBROSIS PANEL,Specific gravity of Urine,Sp Gr Ur,Specific gravity,Urine,,Rden

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.   This test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano.

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C. - SteatoTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - NashTest is interpretable for non alcoholic steatosis. - AshTest is interpretable for alcoholic steatosis.",FIBROACT COMPLETE,Osmolality of Serum or Plasma by calculation,Osmolality SerPl Calc,Osmolality,Ser/Plas,Calculated,Osmol

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.   This test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano.

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C.",LIVER FIBROSIS PANEL,Hepatitis C virus RNA [#/volume] (viral load) in Serum or Plasma by NAA with probe detection,HCV RNA # SerPl NAA+probe,Hepatitis C virus RNA,Ser/Plas,Probe.amp.tar,NCnc

Stage of Fibrosis (F scale)  F0 0.00-0.21 No Fibrosis F0-F1 0.22-0.27 No Fibrosis F1 0.28-0.31 Minimal Fibrosis F1-F2 0.32-0.48 Minimal Fibrosis F2 0.49-0.58 Moderate Fibrosis F3 0.59-0.72 Advanced Fibrosis F3-F4 0.73-0.74 Advanced Fibrosis F4 0.75-1.00 Severe Fibrosis (cirrhosis)  Grade of Necroinflammatory activity (A scale)  A0 0.00-0.17 No Activity A0-A1 0.18-0.29 No Activity A1 0.30-0.36 Minimal Activity A1-A2 0.37-0.52 Minimal Activity A2 0.53-0.60 Significant Activity A2-A3 0.61-0.62 Significant Activity A3 0.63-1.00 Severe Activity --------------------------------------------------------  Haptoglobin results may be affected due to specimen hemolysis. - The reliability of results is dependent on compliance with the preanalytical and analytical conditions recommended by BioPredictive. - The tests have to be deferred for: acute hemolysis, acute hepatitis, acute inflammation, extra hepatic cholestasis. - The advice of a specialist should be sought for interpretation in chronic hemolysis and Gilbert's syndrome. - The test interpretation is not validated in liver transplant patients. - Isolated extreme values of one of the components should lead to caution in interpreting the results. - In case of discordance between a biopsy result and a test, it is recommended to seek the advice of a specialist. The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C.",LIVER FIBROSIS PANEL,Neutrophil cytoplasmic Ab.classic [Titer] in Serum by Immunofluorescence,c-ANCA Titr Ser IF,Neutrophil cytoplasmic Ab.classic,Ser,IF,Titr

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C.",LIVER FIBROSIS PANEL,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D2 [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma","1,25(OH)2D2 SerPl-mCnc","1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D2",Ser/Plas,,MCnc

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C.",LIVER FIBROSIS PANEL,Lymphocytes [#/volume] in Blood by Flow cytometry (FC),Lymphocytes # Bld FC,Lymphocytes,Bld,Flow cytometry,NCnc

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.   This test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano.

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.   This test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano.

Naturally occurring protease inhibitor resistant variants may be present in a small proportion of treatment-naive HCV-infected individuals. In clinical trials, these naturally occurring variants did not preclude a sustained virologic response in most patients undergoing combination therapy that included pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor.  This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.  The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.   This test was developed and its performance characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano.

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C. - SteatoTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - NashTest is interpretable for non alcoholic steatosis. - AshTest is interpretable for alcoholic steatosis.",FIBROACT COMPLETE,Actin smooth muscle Ab [Presence] in Serum by Immunofluorescence,SMA Ab Ser Ql IF,Actin.smooth muscle Ab,Ser,IF,PrThr

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C. - SteatoTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - NashTest is interpretable for non alcoholic steatosis. - AshTest is interpretable for alcoholic steatosis.",FIBROACT COMPLETE,Ketones [Moles/volume] in Unspecified specimen,Ketones XXX-sCnc,Ketones,XXX,,SCnc

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C. - SteatoTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - NashTest is interpretable for non alcoholic steatosis. - AshTest is interpretable for alcoholic steatosis.",FIBROACT COMPLETE,Hepatitis C virus Ab Signal/Cutoff in Serum or Plasma by Immunoassay,HCV Ab s/co SerPl IA,Hepatitis C virus Ab Signal/Cutoff,Ser/Plas,IA,RelACnc

The causes of these discordances could be due to a flaw of the test or to a flaw in the biopsy: i.e. a liver biopsy has a 33% variability rate for one fibrosis stage - FibroTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - ActiTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C. - SteatoTest is interpretable for chronic hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and non alcoholic steatosis. - NashTest is interpretable for non alcoholic steatosis. - AshTest is interpretable for alcoholic steatosis.",FIBROACT COMPLETE,Carcinoembryonic Ag [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma,CEA SerPl-mCnc,Carcinoembryonic Ag,Ser/Plas,,MCnc
