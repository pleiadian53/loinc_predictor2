This assay exhibits increased sensitivity over the HIV-1 Western Blot test and simultaneously differentiates HIV-1 antibody reactivity from HIV-2 antibody reactivity.  A negative HIV-1 antibody Western Blot result does not exclude HIV infection since the time frame for seroconversion is variable. If acute HIV infection is suspected, antibody retesting and HIV-1 RNA Qualitative TMA (order code 16185) is recommended. Testing for HIV-2 should also be considered. Provided sufficient sample remains, additional testing may be added to this specimen by calling your local Quest Laboratory within the next 7 days.

The AFP-L3 Percent assay is intended as a risk assessment for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic liver diseases. Patients with elevated serum AFP-L3 percent should be more intensely evaluated for evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma since elevated values have been shown to be associated with a seven-fold increase in the risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma within 21 months.

The Echosens FibroMeter profile serves as a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and necro-inflammatory activity. A proprietary algorithm calculates and compares results from 7 blood markers along with age and gender to provide a patient score (from 0 to 1) and a correlated fibrosis stage (Metavir F0-F4) and activity grade (Metavir A0-A3). The fibrosis/cirrhosis score is further evaluated by a rules-based system to detect anomalous profile results which may modify the fibrosis/cirrhosis score as needed.  Results should be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's clinical history; particularly when the rules-based system has modified the scores.  Legend:  -Metavir is a histological scoring system for determining the extent of liver fibrosis and inflammation.  STAGE OF FIBROSIS (F scale) F0 = no fibrosis F1 = portal fibrosis without septa F2 = portal fibrosis with few septa F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis F4 = cirrhosis  GRADE OF NECRO-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY (A scale) A0 = no activity A1 = mild activity A2 = moderate activity A3 = severe activity  -Platelet count result provided by client.  -The Prothrombin Index test expresses the Prothrombin Time (PT) as a percentage of normal, and is used to standardize PT results across different instrument/reagent combinations.

The most common reason for failure to    genotype are insufficient virus, mutations in the    viral genome at the assay priming sites, and presence    of inhibitory substance in the sample. Please correlate    this result with any recent viral load for this patient    and resubmit if clinically warranted. A minimum viral    load of 500 IU/mL is required for testing.    This assay is designed to amplify HCV genotypes 1a and 1b and is    unlikely to successfully amplify other HCV genotypes.     This test utilizes RT-PCR and DNA sequencing to detect the presence    of treatment-emergent HCV NS3 protease variants associated with NS3    protease inhibitor antiviral therapy and the Q80K polymorphism,    which is associated with lower simeprevir efficacy.     The clinical significance for antiviral therapy of NS3 resistance    associated variants may vary according to the clinical status and    antiviral treatment experience of the HCV-infected patient.     For further guidance consult with the package inserts of the    applicable direct acting agents and guideline documents such as the    AASLD and IDSA guidelines available at http://hcvguidelines.org.     The limit of detection at which greater than 90% of the samples    tested were successfully amplified is approximately 500 IU/mL.     For additional information, please refer to    http://education.questdiagnostics.com/faq/FAQ132v1.     This test was developed and its analytical performance    characteristics have been determined by Focus Diagnostics.    It has not been cleared or approved by the FDA.

This test utilizes RT-PCR and DNA sequencing to detect the presence of treatment-emergent HCV NS5a variants associated with Ns5a inhibitor antiviral therapy.  The clinical significance of NS5a resistance associated variants for antiviral therapy may vary according to the clinical status and antiviral treatment experience of the HCV-infected patient.  Testing for NS5a resistance-associated variants prior to initiation of treatment with elbasvir plus grazoprevir in HCV genotype 1a infected patients is recommended.
